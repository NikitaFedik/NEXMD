TASKS:

Urgent
1) full ensemble test of restart, has to be relatively long for hops to occur

Less Urgent
1) how to simulate pump-push spectroscopy, possible convolution?
2) push pulse data must come from coords.xyz, coordinate.out, velocity.out, and coeff-n.out - this is to be able use same ensemble data for different pump-push delay times
3) check errflag, change to ERRFLAG (seems cleaner)
4) modify function to calculate multiple dihedral angles simultaneously
5) modify function to calculate multiple bond lengths simultaneously
6) units of nact --> more useful analysis
7) rewrite getexcited to be compatible with python 3

Notes:

1) cross-steps.out and nacr.out - don't understand - they have not been editted for the restart files
